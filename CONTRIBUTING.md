# THANK YOU!

Seriously, thank you! Even if you're just interested in learning more about contributing, thank you! 
Ghast is built on the support of it's community and we sincerely appreciate contributions! This document will
help provide you with some tips for contributing to the project, whether its your first time or five-hundredreth time!

## Code of Conduct

All interactions with this repository are expected to adhere to our code of conduct. [Please review the code of conduct and follow it](https://github.com/bradcypert/ghast/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Issues & Discussions

In this project we leverage Issues and Discussions both. 

Discussions (the discussions tab [here](https://github.com/bradcypert/ghast/discussions)) gives us a home to answer questions, discuss ideas,
flush out the details for feature requests and so much more. I tend to prefer most conversations start as a discussion unless they're a
bug report or security vulnerability.

Issues are used for bug reports and are used to find contributors for feature requests that the I've agreed upon via discussions.

# Reporting Bugs

To report a bug, please [file an issue here](https://github.com/bradcypert/ghast/issues). Please include as much information as possible and ideally
a repository or code example that shows the minumum code needed to reproduce the issue. This helps me triage, debug, and produce a fix faster and
is greatly appreciated.

Please do not "bump" the bugs. Once I've validated that it is a legitimate issue (again, a repository that reproduces the issue makes this very fast),
we'll flag the issue indicating that there's work to be done and will try to let you know on that issue when a fix has been released.

# Submitting a PR

Ghast also accepts outside contributions. Found an issue and have a fix on hand? Send in a PR (or pull request). If you need help submitting a pull request,
you can find [information on how to submit a pull request here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Please fill out the pull request template provided by Github when creating a pull request on Ghast. This helps me indentify what the pull request sets out to do
and if we need to share the fix with an specific issues.

Ghast also has a small set of CI (continuous integration) checks. These checks run on each pull request and help us automate checking common things in our code.
For example, we have a CI check that runs the tests for Ghast. Ultimately, whether these checks need to pass depends on which check it is, but the goal should
be to have them all passing.
